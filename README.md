#Career-Guidance-System 

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Career Guidance System is a comprehensive platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) that provides personalized career advice for students at different stages of their education: primary schooling, secondary schooling, and graduates. By taking into account students' academic performance, interests, and skills, our system suggests suitable career paths and provides detailed information about each option.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>User Input Forms: Tailored forms for students to input their academic scores, interests, and skills.</li>
  <li>Career Suggestions: Based on user inputs, the system provides suggestions for various career paths.</li>
  <li>Detailed Information: Each suggested career path includes information about scope, required skills, top colleges, and 
   resources.</li>
  <li>Graduate Job Guidance: Detailed job information for graduates, including job scope, salary ranges, demand, and required 
   skills.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Node.js: v12.x or higher</li>
  <li>MongoDB: v4.x or higher</li>
  <li>React: v16.x or higher</li>
  <li>Express: v4.x or higher</li>
  <li>Libraries: TensorFlow, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy</li>
</ul>

<h2>AI Model</h2> AI/ML Model
<p>Our AI model enhances the career guidance system by evaluating numerous factors and predicting the best career path based on user inputs. The model takes into account various possibilities and provides insights into the future scope of each career option.</p>

<p><b>This is a full stack project with a trained AI model which was built during a 24-hour hackathon. We did not make any changes after the hackathon. This project showcases the extent of our work within that time frame.</b></p>
